git is version control system

importances of git are:
helps in team collaboration and version control of a project
control of projects
on install git to the system, we can use it's CLI (command line interface)
we upload all the codes somewhere in the cloud and that place is most cases it is GitHub
we have diffrent github like cloud systems like gitlab and bitbucket
we have 2 types of repository in vcs (vesion control system)
1 local repository 
2 remote repository

git commands:

git init : it initializes a local repository

git config --global user.name "me-sajal" : to add user

git config --global user.email "sajalrokka321@gmail.com" :to assign the emalil at gmail



#steps to push the code to GitHub:

git add . OR git add --all : we are supposed to add all the codes in git

git add < file name > : to add the file a file by name

git commit -m "<first commit>"  :

git push -u origin <branch_name> : add the element in the repo file name
git push -u origin2 main

git status :  helps to provide the modified codes and changes in the source code

git branch : gives all the branches in the git and highlights the current branches

git branch -M main : used to change the branch master to main

git remote add origin < username| host-alias and ssh-link> : adds a new origin to local. 
git remote add origin2 git@github.com:me-sajal/PracticeWorksPython.git 
This is done to establish connection between local and remote repos.

git remote -v : to see if there is git connected or not into a repo

git remote -v : displays all the users | alias in the code or project 

git remote remove <remote_name> : removes the alisas name (origin)

git diff : shows the recent activites


ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sajalrokka321@gmail.com" : to get the ssh public and private keys 
{ do it in cmd and so on}
